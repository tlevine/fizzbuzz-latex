Directions from the \href{https://www.hackerschool.com/apply}{Hacker School Application}:
Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive).

If the number is divisible by 3, print Fizz instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Buzz. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
